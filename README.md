# Weather Data Analysis Project

## Project Description
This project involves analyzing weather data, focusing on temperature and humidity. The analysis includes:
- Calculating mean temperature and humidity.
- Determining maximum and minimum temperature and humidity.
- Creating time series plots for temperature and humidity.
- Plotting a monthly average bar chart.

## Tools Used
- MATLAB

## Data Source
The data used for analysis is a CSV file containing the following columns:
- Date
- Temperature
- Humidity

## Features
- Extracts data from CSV files.
- Calculates mean, max, and min temperature and humidity.
- Handles missing data.
- Creates visualizations (line and bar plots).
- Generates a comprehensive report as a script and PDF.

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have MATLAB installed.
3. Place your weather data CSV file in the project directory.
4. Run the MATLAB script (`weather_data.m` or similar) to perform the analysis and generate visualizations.

## Files Included
- `weather_data.m`: MATLAB script for data analysis and visualization.
- `weather_data.csv`: Sample weather data file.
- `README.md`: Project description and details.

## Results
- The script can process any CSV file formatted with date, temperature, and humidity columns.
- Outputs include mean, max, and min values, time-series plots, and monthly average bar graphs.
